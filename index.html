<h1 style="font-size: 150%;color: #feee00;" style="font-size:100 px">Religion
    <p style="font-side:35%">This first major religion practiced was animalism, which is the belief that all abiotic and biotic things possess a kami (soul). These beliefs were closely related to the daily life of the ancient Vietnamese, who worshiped spirits associated with natural features such as mountains, rivers, lakes, and animals.  
Buddhism is the most popular religion in Vietnam, with about ten million followers. It was introduced to Vietnam in two ways, the Mahayana sect via China, and the Hinayana sect via Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos.
The second largest foreign religion in Vietnam is Catholicism, with about six million followers. Catholicism was introduced to Vietnam by Spanish, Portuguese, and French missionaries early in the 17th century. Today, over 6,000 churches across Vietnam engage in religious activities.
